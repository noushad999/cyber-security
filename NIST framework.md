🛡️ NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)
The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a structured approach for managing security and privacy risks in information systems. Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), RMF integrates security, privacy, and cyber supply chain risk management into the system development lifecycle.

📖 Overview
The RMF provides a seven-step process that helps organizations:

Categorize and assess risks.
Implement and evaluate controls.
Continuously monitor system security.
Purpose: To ensure systems operate securely within acceptable risk levels, aligning with organizational missions and compliance requirements.

🔁 RMF Process Steps
Step 1: Prepare
Objective: Establish the foundation for managing security and privacy risks.
Key Activities:
Identify stakeholders.
Define roles and responsibilities.
Conduct risk assessments.
Output: Risk management strategy, initial system context.
Step 2: Categorize the System
Objective: Define the system’s security impact level based on its data and functions.
Key Activities:
Use FIPS 199 to categorize information types.
Identify confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.
Output: System security categorization document.
Step 3: Select Controls
Objective: Choose appropriate security and privacy controls.
Key Activities:
Reference NIST SP 800-53.
Tailor controls based on system needs.
Output: Security and privacy control baseline.
Step 4: Implement Controls
Objective: Apply the selected controls in the system.
Key Activities:
Configure system settings.
Document implementation details.
Output: System security plan (SSP) with implemented controls.
Step 5: Assess Controls
Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness of implemented controls.
Key Activities:
Conduct security testing and evaluations.
Identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
Output: Security assessment report (SAR).
Step 6: Authorize System
Objective: Obtain approval to operate the system based on risk acceptance.
Key Activities:
Review assessment findings.
Document residual risks.
Issue an authorization to operate (ATO).
Output: Authorization decision document.
Step 7: Monitor
Objective: Continuously track system security and privacy post-authorization.
Key Activities:
Monitor control effectiveness.
Update risk assessments.
Address vulnerabilities promptly.
Output: Continuous monitoring reports.
