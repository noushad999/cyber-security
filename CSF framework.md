# **Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**

The **Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (**NIST**) to help organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risks. It is widely adopted across industries to strengthen security measures and align them with business objectives.

## **Core Components of the CSF**
The CSF consists of three key components:

1. **Framework Core**  
2. **Implementation Tiers**  
3. **Framework Profiles**

---

### **1. Framework Core**
The Framework Core is a set of cybersecurity activities, desired outcomes, and applicable references. It is structured around five primary functions:

| **Function**  | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Identify**  | Develop an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risks.          |
| **Protect**   | Implement safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services.    |
| **Detect**    | Develop and implement activities to identify cybersecurity incidents.           |
| **Respond**   | Take action regarding detected cybersecurity incidents.                         |
| **Recover**   | Maintain resilience and restore capabilities affected by cybersecurity events.  |

---

### **2. Implementation Tiers**
The Tiers help organizations understand their approach to managing cybersecurity risks. They range from **Partial (Tier 1)** to **Adaptive (Tier 4)**:

| **Tier**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tier 1: Partial**  | Informal, reactive approach to managing risk.                             |
| **Tier 2: Risk-Informed** | Risk management practices are approved but not consistently implemented. |
| **Tier 3: Repeatable** | Formalized risk management practices that are regularly updated.         |
| **Tier 4: Adaptive**   | Organization adapts to evolving threats with advanced risk management.   |

### **3. Framework Profiles**
Framework Profiles align the Framework Core with business requirements, risk tolerance, and resources. They represent the current and desired states of cybersecurity.  
- **Current Profile:** Reflects the organization's existing cybersecurity posture.  
- **Target Profile:** Defines the organization's desired cybersecurity outcomes.

## **Five Functions in Detail**

### **1. Identify**
- Understand organizational context, assets, and risks.
- **Key Categories:**
  - Asset Management
  - Business Environment
  - Governance
  - Risk Assessment
  - Supply Chain Risk Management

### **2. Protect**
- Develop and implement safeguards for critical services.
- **Key Categories:**
  - Access Control
  - Awareness and Training
  - Data Security
  - Information Protection Processes
  - Maintenance
  - Protective Technology

### **3. Detect**
- Establish mechanisms to identify cybersecurity events.
- **Key Categories:**
  - Anomalies and Events
  - Security Continuous Monitoring
  - Detection Processes

### **4. Respond**
- Take actions to mitigate the impact of cybersecurity incidents.
- **Key Categories:**
  - Response Planning
  - Communications
  - Analysis
  - Mitigation
  - Improvements

### **5. Recover**
- Ensure timely recovery of operations and services.
- **Key Categories:**
  - Recovery Planning
  - Improvements
  - Communications

## **Benefits of the CSF**
- Aligns cybersecurity with business needs.
- Improves risk management and communication across stakeholders.
- Facilitates regulatory compliance.
- Enhances resilience against evolving threats.

---

## **How to Use the CSF**
1. **Assess Current State:** Use the Current Profile to evaluate your existing cybersecurity posture.  
2. **Set Goals:** Define a Target Profile based on organizational goals and risk tolerance.  
3. **Prioritize Actions:** Focus on areas requiring improvement to move closer to the Target Profile.  
4. **Implement Changes:** Apply measures aligned with the Framework Core's functions and categories.  
5. **Monitor and Improve:** Continuously monitor your cybersecurity posture and update the Framework Profile as necessary.
