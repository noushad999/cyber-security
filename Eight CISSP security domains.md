# **CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) - 8 Domains**

The CISSP certification, governed by (ISC)Â², covers eight domains from the **Common Body of Knowledge (CBK)**. These domains encompass the critical areas of cybersecurity knowledge necessary to design, implement, and manage a robust security program.

---

## **1. Security and Risk Management**
- **Focus:** Establishing and managing the overall security governance framework and risk management process.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA triad)
  - Security governance principles
  - Compliance with laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, SOX)
  - Risk management and analysis techniques
  - Business continuity planning (BCP) and disaster recovery planning (DRP)
  - Code of ethics and professional conduct

---

## **2. Asset Security**
- **Focus:** Protecting organizational assets throughout their lifecycle.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Data classification and ownership
  - Data retention policies
  - Privacy protection techniques
  - Secure handling and storage of assets
  - Data encryption and secure disposal

---

## **3. Security Architecture and Engineering**
- **Focus:** Designing and implementing secure infrastructures and systems.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Secure design principles
  - Cryptography (e.g., symmetric, asymmetric, hashing, digital signatures)
  - Physical security considerations
  - Security models (e.g., Bell-LaPadula, Biba, Clark-Wilson)
  - System vulnerabilities, threats, and countermeasures

---

## **4. Communication and Network Security**
- **Focus:** Securing network architecture, design, and transmission methods.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Network protocols and secure communication (e.g., HTTPS, TLS)
  - Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS)
  - VPNs, wireless security
  - Network segmentation and zoning
  - Cloud network security

---

## **5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
- **Focus:** Controlling access to systems and data based on identity verification.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Authentication methods (e.g., passwords, biometrics, multi-factor authentication)
  - Authorization techniques (e.g., RBAC, ABAC)
  - Identity federation and single sign-on (SSO)
  - Privileged account management (PAM)
  - Directory services (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP)

---

## **6. Security Assessment and Testing**
- **Focus:** Validating the effectiveness of security controls and identifying vulnerabilities.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Security control testing (e.g., penetration testing, vulnerability scanning)
  - Log review and audit management
  - Risk assessments and gap analysis
  - Security awareness training
  - Testing methodologies and tools

---

## **7. Security Operations**
- **Focus:** Monitoring and managing security operations to detect and respond to incidents.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Incident response and handling
  - Forensic investigation techniques
  - Continuous monitoring (e.g., SIEM tools, threat intelligence)
  - Disaster recovery and business continuity operations
  - Patch and configuration management
  - Threat hunting and response strategies

---

## **8. Software Development Security**
- **Focus:** Ensuring secure coding practices and integrating security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- **Key Topics:**
  - Secure software development practices
  - Application vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10)
  - Software testing and validation
  - DevSecOps and CI/CD pipeline security
  - Security in application environments (e.g., APIs, microservices, container security)
