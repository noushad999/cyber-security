## 4. Effectiveness of Social Engineering

Social engineering is highly effective due to its ability to manipulate human trust, making individuals more susceptible to attacks.

### Why Social Engineering Works:
- **Authority**: Attackers impersonate trusted or high-authority individuals, as people are conditioned to follow authority figures.
- **Intimidation**: Attackers use threats or pressure to coerce individuals into providing access or information.
- **Consensus/Social Proof**: Exploiting people's tendencies to follow the crowd, attackers make it seem like others have already complied.
- **Scarcity**: Threat actors create urgency by suggesting limited availability of services or items.
- **Familiarity**: Attackers build an emotional connection with the target, making them more likely to trust and act on requests.
- **Trust**: Over time, attackers manipulate trust, making it easier to gain personal information.
- **Urgency**: The threat of immediate consequences pressures the target into acting quickly without thought.
