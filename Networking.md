## What is Networking?
Networking refers to the process of connecting computers, servers, and other devices together to share resources and communicate with each other. It enables devices to exchange data and provides a platform for applications and services to operate across multiple devices.

## Models in Networking

### 1. OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)
A conceptual framework that standardizes how different computer systems communicate over a network. It consists of **7 layers**:
1. **Physical Layer**: Deals with hardware transmission.
2. **Data Link Layer**: Manages data frames between devices.
3. **Network Layer**: Handles routing of data packets.
4. **Transport Layer**: Ensures end-to-end communication.
5. **Session Layer**: Manages sessions between devices.
6. **Presentation Layer**: Translates data formats.
7. **Application Layer**: Provides user services like email and file transfer.

### 2. TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model)
A more practical model, often used as the basis for the internet. It consists of **4 layers**:
1. **Network Interface Layer**: Corresponds to OSI's physical and data link layers.
2. **Internet Layer**: Handles IP addressing and routing.
3. **Transport Layer**: Manages end-to-end communication and data integrity (TCP/UDP).
4. **Application Layer**: Manages high-level communication, e.g., HTTP, FTP.

## Servers and Types of Servers

### What is a Server?
A server is a powerful computer or device that provides services or resources to other computers (clients) on the network. Servers manage data, resources, and services for multiple clients simultaneously.

### Types of Servers:
1. **File Server**: Stores and manages files for network clients.
2. **Web Server**: Hosts websites and serves web pages to users over the internet.
3. **Database Server**: Provides database services and manages database-related queries.
4. **Mail Server**: Manages and facilitates email services for users.
5. **DNS Server**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses for network communication.
6. **Proxy Server**: Acts as an intermediary between a client and the server for security and caching.
7. **Game Server**: Hosts multiplayer online games and manages game-related data and player interactions.

## Types of Networks

1. **LAN (Local Area Network)**:
   - Covers a small geographical area (e.g., within a building or campus).
   - High data transfer rates and low latency.
   - Typically connected using Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi.

2. **WAN (Wide Area Network)**:
   - Covers a large geographical area (e.g., between cities, countries).
   - Slower data transfer rates compared to LAN, but allows for long-distance communication.
   - The internet is the largest example of a WAN.

3. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**:
   - Covers a city or metropolitan area.
   - Typically used for connecting multiple LANs in a city.
   - Provides a middle-ground between LAN and WAN in terms of data speed and range.

4. **PAN (Personal Area Network)**:
   - A small network for personal devices, typically within a range of a few meters.
   - Examples: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi for personal devices.

5. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**:
   - A secure, encrypted connection over the internet that allows remote users or offices to connect to a private network.
   - Provides privacy and security when accessing data over untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi.

## Types of Network Topologies

1. **Bus Topology**:
   - A single central cable (bus) connects all devices.
   - Cheap and easy to install but prone to network failure if the central bus fails.

2. **Star Topology**:
   - All devices are connected to a central device (hub or switch).
   - Highly reliable; if one device fails, it doesn't affect others, but if the central device fails, the whole network is affected.

3. **Ring Topology**:
   - Devices are connected in a circular fashion.
   - Data travels in one direction, passing through each device until it reaches the destination.
   - Can be slow due to the need for data to travel through every device.

4. **Mesh Topology**:
   - Every device is connected to every other device.
   - Provides high redundancy and reliability, as there are multiple paths for data to travel.
   - Expensive and complex to install.

5. **Tree Topology**:
   - Combines characteristics of bus and star topologies.
   - Devices are grouped in a hierarchical structure, with central nodes connecting to higher nodes.
   - Allows for scalability but may suffer if the central node fails.

6. **Hybrid Topology**:
   - A combination of two or more topologies.
   - Designed to meet specific network requirements for scalability, reliability, and performance.
